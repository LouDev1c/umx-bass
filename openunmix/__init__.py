Open-Unmix is a deep neural network reference implementation for music source separation, applicable for researchers, audio engineers and artists. Open-Unmix provides ready-to-use models that allow users to separate pop music into four stems: vocals, drums, bass and the remaining other instruments. The models were pre-trained on the MUSDB18 dataset. See details at apply pre-trained model.

This is the python package API documentation. 
Please check out [the open-unmix website](https://sigsep.github.io/open-unmix) for more information.
